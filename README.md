- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pattyo20
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning about web and app development, particularly on the front end side to start but I want to eventually learn enough to work as a full stack developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to write HTML and CSS code and am about to start on Javascript hopefully within the next couple of weeks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... honestly I don't really know yet. I think I'd be interested in whatever would let me improve my experience.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I recently opened up a more professional email address for anything project or work related and you can reach me there at oconnor-patrick@outlook.com
